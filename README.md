# WRST climate futures creation
Developed by: [Amber Runyon, Ph.D](amber_runyon@nps.gov) - *NPS Climate Change Response Program*

*Contents of this repository were developed for generating spatial climate futures for Wrangell-St. Elias NPP. If you wish to use this code, please contact developers.*

## Contents of repository

This project has four steps, each contained in a RMarkdown document:

**1. Select climate futures from top-tier climate metrics**
[*Script: Spatial_T1_extraction.Rmd*](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/WRST-climate-futures/blob/main/Spatial_T1_extraction.Rmd)

This script...

**2. Calculate climate metrics for selected climate futures**
[*Script: Variable_calculations.Rmd*](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/WRST-climate-futures/blob/main/Variable_calculations.Rmd)


This script...

**3. Plot climate metrics for selected geographies**
[*Script: plot-creation.Rmd*](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/WRST-climate-futures/blob/main/plot-creation.Rmd.Rmd)


This script...


**4. Create reports for park resources. Separate report generated for each of the eight resource groups**
[*e.g. sccript: Vegetation-report.Rmd*](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/WRST-climate-futures/blob/main/Vegetation-report.Rmd)
